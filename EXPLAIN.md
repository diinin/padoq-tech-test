I initially read the READme that was sent to us to complete the task a few times to ensure that I understood what the task was asking me to do. 
I then had a look at the code in the App.js file and made sure I understood what each line of code meant. 
I realised that the code within the App.js had to be seperated in different folders and files in order for the website to function more appropriately. 
I also noticed that the components were not being imported properly within the code that was given to us, therefore deciding that it is best that I fixed the issue. 
I also noticed that there were no export defaults added within the codes, which is something that I had to add after I separated the code and components out in different folders. 
For testing, I only had time to complete the AddTodo part within the 2 hr framework.
