## How you approached the test:

I found that the best way for me to approach the test was to read the ReadME file a few times to ensure that I understood the problem. I then decided to make a plan detailing the steps that I am going to take. I ensured that my plan was laid out in bullet points to ensure that I ticked it off as I went down the list. 
I also had a look through all the folders and files that was initially present in the repo to ensure that I understood what the different codes were doing. 
I then made a component folder within the src folder. I then decided to make 3 files called 'AddTodo', 'Todo' and 'Todos' as stated in the app.js file within this repo.
I have not worked with class components before so I had to do a bit of research about this before I started organising the different components files. 

## What you would do differently if you took the test again?

I would set more time aside for the testing section of this test. I was not able to finish off this section within the 2 hr timeframe that was set for us to complete the task. I would also write bullet pointed lists for my plan within the EXPLAIN.md as opposed to the paragraph text to save more time. I only decided to write paragraphs due to ensuring that my plan is as detailed as possible and that I don't forget important bits of code that I had to do. 

## Improvements to the application you can suggest that could be implemented, and an estimation of how much time they would take. 

I would incorporate a lot more CSS and general stylying to the app to make it a more interactive and user-friendly application. I would also give add a drop down list in the ToDo search bar with previous auto suggestions of task that were added in before to allow the user to save time. In order to do this I would need to esnure that the database will save the previous todo lists that were added by users before. 


## How long would the improvement take

Making changes to the CSS and general styling, as well as adding in an autocomplete function would take around a day to complete.
